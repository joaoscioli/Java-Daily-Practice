# Day 03 - Concurrency, Database Setup, and Code Refactoring

## âœ… Task 1: Concurrency (Threads & Executors)
- **Objective:** Learn how to work with Threads, Runnable, Callable, and Executors.
- **Files:** [ConcurrencyExample.java](src/ConcurrencyExample.java)

### Key Concepts:
- Thread creation using `Thread` and `Runnable`
- Using `ExecutorService` to manage thread pools
- Handling concurrency with `Callable` and `Future`

## âœ… Task 2: Database Setup (PostgreSQL)
- **Objective:** Install and configure PostgreSQL.
- **Steps:**
    - Install PostgreSQL on your machine.
    - Create a new database and table.
    - Connect the database to a Spring Boot application.
- **Files:** [DatabaseSetup](DatabaseSetup/)

## âœ… Task 3: Code Refactoring Challenge
- **Objective:** Refactor an existing Java codebase to improve readability, performance, and maintainability.
- **Task:**
    - Identify code smells (e.g., long methods, duplicate code).
    - Apply refactoring techniques such as method extraction, renaming, and simplifying conditions.

ðŸŽ¯ **Daily Reflection:**
- Today I explored Java concurrency, learned how to set up a PostgreSQL database, and practiced code refactoring. These are essential skills for writing efficient, maintainable, and scalable software.
