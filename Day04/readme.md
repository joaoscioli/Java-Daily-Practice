# Day 04 - Advanced Streams, JWT Authentication, and Code Review

## âœ… Task 1: Advanced Streams Practice
- **Objective:** Explore advanced operations in Java Streams, including parallel streams, collectors, and custom stream operations.
- **Files:** [AdvancedStreamsExample.java](src/AdvancedStreamsExample.java)

### Key Concepts:
- Parallel Streams
- Custom Collectors
- Stream Performance Considerations

## âœ… Task 2: Implement JWT Authentication
- **Objective:** Create a Spring Boot application with JWT-based authentication.
- **Project:** [JwtAuthenticationProject](JwtAuthenticationProject/)
- **Endpoints:**
    - `POST /auth/login` - Authenticate a user and return a JWT token
    - `GET /api/resource` - Access a protected resource using the JWT token

## âœ… Task 3: Code Review Challenge
- **Objective:** Conduct a thorough code review on an existing project.
- **Task:**
    - Identify areas for improvement (naming, structure, efficiency).
    - Provide comments and suggestions for refactoring.

ðŸŽ¯ **Daily Reflection:**
- Today I dived deep into advanced Java Streams, implemented JWT authentication for a Spring Boot project, and practiced code review. I gained a better understanding of secure API development and the importance of code quality.
